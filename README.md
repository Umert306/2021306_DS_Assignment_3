Netflix Dataset Analysis Using Apache Spark
Project Overview
This project leverages Apache Spark in a Dockerized environment to perform an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Netflix dataset. The dataset, available in CSV format, contains detailed information about the TV shows and movies currently available on Netflix. Key data points include titles, types (Movies or TV Shows), release years, ratings, and other relevant metadata.

The primary goal of this analysis is to gain insights into:

The distribution of content types (Movies vs TV Shows).
Trends related to the release years of the content.
Handling and cleaning of missing or inconsistent data.
By utilizing Apache Spark, this project demonstrates the power of distributed data processing to handle large-scale datasets efficiently.
